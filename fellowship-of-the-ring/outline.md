# Overview and Foundation for Composition

## Content draws from: 

1. 00-introduction-notation-purity-mapping
2. 03-partial-application-parameters-order-generic-types
3. 04-composition-notation-typescript-syntax

Excluded: 
- 01 file is empty
- 02 gets too in the weeds about notation, pull out only necessary parts for #2

## End goal: 
To write existing methods with Generic Syntax:
- .map
- .filter
- etc

## Themes: 
1. Definitions and overview:
- Defining the parts of a function
- Overview of types, pros/cons
- Pure vs impure/side effects
- Referential transparency

2. Bigger picture and group application:
- Generic types
- Partial application
- Demo a small normal TS function converting into generic

3. Stepping through and independent application:
- Step through making a common method into a generically typed one
	- Break down functions in TS
	- Isolate different parts
	- Convert to generic
	- Run code?
