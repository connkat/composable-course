# Intro to Types


## What you need to know coming in
- basics of FP
- JS
## Content draws from: 

1. 00-introduction-notation-purity-mapping
2. 03-partial-application-parameters-order-generic-types
3. 04-composition-notation-typescript-syntax

## End goal: 
To write existing methods with Generic Syntax:
- .map
- .filter
- etc
--What are these things doing internally for you? 
--How do we express them in a typesafe manner?
--How do we express them generically?

## Themes: 
1. Definitions and overview:
- Defining the parts of a function
- Pure vs impure/side effects
- Referential transparency
** Do a map/filter and see what it does

2. Bigger picture and group application:
- Overview of types, pros/cons
- Isolate and breakdown higher order functions
** Build your own version or map/filter

3. Stepping through and independent application:
- Step through making a common method into a generically typed one
- Break down functions in TS
- Generic types
--Importance of being able to pass in functions as args (high order functs)

** Make existing into generic



------
V1: inclusive of high order, maybe not generics
V2: focus on small and simple functions, apply generically
