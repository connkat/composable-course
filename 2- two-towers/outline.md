# Higher order functions and their application

## What you need to know coming in
- basics of TS (types and generic)
- application of map and filter

## notes
- use more generic types in practical ways
- high order functions 
- decks examples? 


## Draws from: 
- 

## Lesson 1:  Types  = good
- Update previous work to not use `any`. 
- Syntax for function types

## Lesson 2: Generic types = better
- Syntax walkthrough
- Figure out a function that can take .map or .filter for the same end
- Generic React list Component? 

## Takeaway
- Find a take home one


## End goal: 
- rewriting high order functions generically 
- How do we write functions that receive other functions as params
-
